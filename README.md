## Another Django Shell

A simple django shell template to include all models.
It uses IPython.

**I know** django-extensions do it, (with much more extra cool features), But I like simple codes. This one has a beginners level.
Add command into any app.

Works for Django 1.9.5 idk for the others.

THe file is "as is", do whatever you want to do, the responsibility belongs to you.
